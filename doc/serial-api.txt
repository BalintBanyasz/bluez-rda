Serial hierarchy
================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.Serial
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX

Methods		string Connect(string pattern)

			Connects to a specific RFCOMM based service on a
			remote device and then creates a RFCOMM TTY
			device for it. The RFCOMM TTY device is returned.

			Possible patterns: UUID 128 bit as string
					   Profile short names, e.g: spp, dun
					   RFCOMM channel as string, 1-30

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
					 org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed
					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported

Methods		fd ConnectFD(string pattern) [experimental]

			Connects to a specific RFCOMM based service on a
			remote device and returns a file descriptor to talk
			 with this device.

			Possible patterns: UUID 128 bit as string
					   Profile short names, e.g: spp, dun
					   RFCOMM channel as string, 1-30

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
					 org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed
					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported


		void Disconnect(string device)

			Disconnect a RFCOMM TTY device that has been
			created by Connect method.

			To abort a connection attempt in case of errors or
			timeouts in the client it is fine to call this method.

			In that case one of patterns of the Connect method should
			be supplied instead of the TTY device.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist

Serial Proxy Manager hierarchy [experimental]
=============================================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.SerialProxyManager
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}

Methods		array{string} ListProxies()

			Returns an array of the object path strings of
			all the proxies created for the adapter.

		string CreateProxy(string pattern, string address)

			Possible patterns: UUID 128 bit as string
					   Profile short names, e.g: spp, dun
					   RFCOMM channel as string, 1-30

			Address is the path to the TTY or Unix socket to be used.
			Only one proxy per address (TTY or Unix socket)
			is allowed.

			The object path of created proxy is returned.
			On success this will emit a ProxyCreated signal.

			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

		void RemoveProxy(string path)

			This removes the proxy object at the given path.
			On success this will emit a ProxyRemoved signal.

			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist
					 org.bluez.Error.NotAuthorized

Signals		ProxyCreated(string path)

			This signal indicates a proxy was created.
			Parameter is object path of created proxy.

		ProxyRemoved(string path)

			This signal indicates a proxy was removed.
			Parameter is object path of removed proxy.

Serial Proxy hierarchy [experimental]
=====================================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.SerialProxy
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/{proxy0,proxy1,...}

Methods		void Enable()

			Starts to listen to the TTY or Unix socket, allocates
			a RFCOMM channel and add record to the server.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed

		void Disable()

			Stops to listen to the TTY or Unix socket, shutdown
			the RFCOMM channel allocated for the proxy, and remove
			record from the server.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed

		dict GetInfo()

			Returns all properties for the proxy. See the
			properties section for available properties.

		void SetSerialParameters(string rate, uint8 data, uint8 stop,
			string parity)

			Configures serial communication setting baud rate,
			data bits, stop bits and parity.

			Doesn't allow change TTY settings if it is open.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.NotAuthorized

Properties	string uuid [readonly]

			128-bit UUID that represents the available remote service.

		string address [readonly]

			Address is the path to the TTY or Unix socket name used,
			set when the proxy was created.

		uint8 channel [readonly]

			RFCOMM channel.

		boolean enabled [readonly]

			Indicates if the proxy is currently enabled.

		boolean connected [readonly]

			Indicates if the proxy is currently connected.
